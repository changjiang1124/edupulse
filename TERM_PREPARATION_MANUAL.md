## 1. Duplicating Courses for Next Term

To continue a course in the next term without creating it from scratch:

1.  Navigate to the **[Course List](/academics/courses/)**.
2.  Click on the course you want to duplicate to view its details.
3.  In the course header (top-right), click the **Edit** dropdown button (or **Duplicate** button if the course is Archived).
4.  Select **Duplicate**.
5.  A confirmation modal will appear.

### Rolling Over Enrollments
In the duplication modal, you will see an option:
*   **"Include existing enrollments as 'Pending'?"**

**Check this box** if you want to copy the students currently enrolled in this course to the new term.
*   The new enrollments will be created with **Pending** status.
*   Fees will be recalculated based on the new course's pricing.
*   This allows you to secure spots for returning students before opening to the public.

6.  Click **Duplicate Course**.
7.  The new course will be created in **Draft** status.
    *   *Tip: Update the course dates and any price changes before publishing.*

## 2. Sending Payment Reminders

Once your students are enrolled (or rolled over) with "Pending" status, you can send bulk payment reminders.

1.  Go to the **[Enrollment List](/enrollment/)**.
2.  Use the filters to find the relevant enrollments:
    *   **Course**: Select the new term's course.
    *   **Status**: Select **Pending**.
    *   Click **Filter**.
3.  Select the students you want to remind:
    *   Check the box next to individual students, or
    *   Check the **Select All** box at the top of the table.
4.  In the **Bulk Actions** menu (appears after selection):
    *   Choose **Remind Payment**.
    *   Click **Apply**.
5.  A modal will appear showing the specific "Payment Reminder" template.
    *   This sends an **Email** and **SMS** (if enabled) with bank transfer details and the amount due.
6.  Click **Send Notification**.

> **Note:** The system will process these notifications in the background. You can monitor the progress bar until completion.

"""
Comprehensive test script for enrollment duplicate prevention functionality.

Tests both course-level and class-level duplicate enrollment prevention
across all enrollment creation points:
1. EnrollmentForm (admin interface)
2. StaffEnrollmentForm (staff interface)  
3. PublicEnrollmentView (public enrollment)

Also tests that cancelled enrollments are allowed to be re-enrolled.

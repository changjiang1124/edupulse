1. now the style is too colourful. let's make it simpler. avoiding too many bold colour blocks. refine paddings and 2px radius for all elements. 
2. interface should be in Australian English, rather than the current Chinese. 
3. let's continue with the course management mentioned in @proposal.md. the course should have it's period, and status should be adjusted accordingly if published (default draft). the status could affect the wordpress synchronisation in the future. course period could be in the same day (e.g. workshop, rather than a term course with multiple dates.) 

class is a term under course. the relationship between Course and Class, should be 1:n. classes under course could be created with repeated dates (e.g. every Monday from start date to end date.) 

Course should have its description, and short description, which will be used to mapping with woocommerce.
